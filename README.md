1. The Problem (Thermal Choking)
Current autonomous medical nanobots (white blood cell scale) are limited by "thermal choking." The heat generated by high-resolution imaging (LEDs/Metasurfaces), onboard AI processing chips, and active propulsion (Ion jets) exceeds the dissipation capacity of the surrounding fluid (blood). This prevents true autonomy and continuous high-power operation.
2. The Solution (The "Yakchal" Loop)
This disclosure proposes a closed-loop micro-refrigeration system integrated into the robot chassis, inspired by historical phase-change cooling (Yakchals and early SO_2 refrigeration).
Working Fluid: Liquid Sulfur Dioxide (SO_2). Selected for its high latent heat of vaporization and manageable phase-change pressures at the micro-scale.
The Cycle:
Evaporation (Cooling): Liquid SO_2 is passed through a micro-channel evaporator in direct contact with the onboard AI processor and LED driver. The SO_2 absorbs the waste heat and transitions into a gas, cooling the components.
Compression: A micro-piezoelectric or electrostatic compressor increases the pressure of the gas.
Condensation: The hot, pressurized gas moves to the robot’s outer hull (the "skin"), where heat is dumped into the bloodstream (acting as a 37°C heat sink). The SO_2 returns to a liquid state.
Expansion: The liquid passes through a nano-aperture to drop pressure and repeat the cycle.
3. Integrated Systems
Vision: Micro-LED for active illumination + Metasurface "Night Vision" sensor.
Power: Bio-resorbable Sodium-Ion micro-battery.
Locomotion: Electrophoretic ion jetpack for viscous fluids.
Anchoring: Gecko-inspired adhesive micro-legs for vessel wall attachment.
Payload: High-frequency shockwave generator (piezoelectric) and thermal drill for cellular-level intervention.
4. Statement of Novelty
This system architecture specifically enables onboard AI processing and active night vision by preventing thermal meltdown, a combination previously considered unfeasible due to heat constraints.
